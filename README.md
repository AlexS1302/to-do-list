* __Interactive Tasks__: Easily delete, mark as completed or edit tasks at any time.
* __Cute Animations__: Enjoy small animations that add a touch of personality and make interactions more engaging.
* __Local Storage Integration__: Automatically saves your tasks and projects locally so they persist even after refreshing the page.
